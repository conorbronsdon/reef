"""``alphacumen.tools`` -- IA tool surface, expressed over the platform verbs.

This is the slice 5c.5 cutover: every IA-specific @tool that used to
live in ``gdelt.project.agents.lg_tools`` and dispatch to the
hand-rolled ``eval/memory_bench/.../tool_*`` functions is now a
3-to-15-line dispatcher over one of the seven generic kernel verbs
exposed by ``coralbricks.sandbox.tools`` and
``coralbricks.sandbox.llm`` (the platform foundation):

- ``tools.bm25``      -- OpenSearch BM25 search.
- ``tools.ann``       -- approximate nearest-neighbor (HNSW).
- ``tools.sql``       -- DuckDB-over-Parquet SELECT.
- ``tools.multihop``  -- knowledge-graph BFS.
- ``tools.get``       -- single-doc hydration by ``(index, id)``.
- ``tools.py``        -- in-runner Python interpreter for analytics.

Tool names follow a ``<verb>_<corpus>`` shape so the model can pick
the right surface from the name alone:

- ``bm25_gdelt``              -- BM25 over GDELT events (OpenSearch).
- ``bm25_sec``                -- BM25 over SEC EDGAR filings (Turbopuffer).
- ``bm25_scraped_articles``   -- BM25 over scraped web articles (OpenSearch).
- ``vector_scraped_articles`` -- ANN over scraped web articles (BGE-M3, OpenSearch).
- ``query_graph``             -- DuckDB SQL on the GDELT+SEC KG.
- ``multihop_graph``          -- BFS on the same KG.
- ``get_full_text``           -- single-doc hydration across the search corpora.
- ``get_macro_series`` / ``get_equity_bars`` -- typed time-series accessors.
- ``get_reddit_sentiment`` / ``search_reddit_posts`` -- daily VADER
                                 sentiment aggregates and full-text post
                                 search over the pullpush.io Reddit
                                 backfill (typed dispatchers over
                                 ``tools.sql`` against ``reddit_pullpush_v1``).
- ``compute_technicals``      -- ``get_equity_bars`` + ``tools.py`` snippet
                                 (server-side composition; bars never enter
                                 the model context).
- ``run_python``              -- raw ``tools.py`` over arbitrary
                                 ``inputs={...}``; use for fusing
                                 search rankings (RRF), ad-hoc dedup,
                                 small post-processing.

Each one is a thin index-binding adapter: it picks the right
kernel verb + index slug + parameter shape and forwards the call.

Score fusion across legs (BM25 + ANN, multi-field BM25, ...) is
*not* exposed as its own tool. Within a single ``bm25_*`` call the
gateway transparently fuses per-field BM25 sub-queries with
weighted RRF when the index is Turbopuffer-backed (see
:func:`gateway.search.turbopuffer_bm25._weighted_rrf`); OpenSearch
multi-field BM25 is fused natively by the OS ``multi_match``
scorer. Cross-verb fusion (BM25 + ANN) is the model's job: invoke
``bm25_scraped_articles`` and ``vector_scraped_articles`` as two
separate tool calls and reason over both rankings.

Why this matters
----------------

1. **One tool kernel, many tools.** Previously every IA tool was a
   bespoke implementation reaching directly into OpenSearch /
   DuckDB / cuGraph / S3 from inside the pipeline. That code path
   is now gone -- the gateway's :class:`~gateway.rpc.tool_kernel.ToolKernel`
   owns all backend access. alphacumen just describes which index it
   wants and what shape of result it needs.

2. **Sandboxed by construction.** All alphacumen tool calls now flow
   through the per-run RPC socket, which is the only outbound
   surface the sandbox has. No backend credentials reach the
   pipeline, no direct egress is possible, the gateway can meter /
   cap / log every call.

3. **Trajectory + caching are the gateway's problem.** The legacy
   :class:`_TOOL_CACHE` / ``_session_cache`` machinery that lived in
   ``lg_tools.py`` is replaced by the gateway's per-run accounting.
   Tools here are stateless dispatchers; rate-limiting, idempotency
   keys, and trajectory recording are platform concerns.

4. **``compute_technicals`` is now ``tools.py`` instead of a
   bespoke handler.** This is the validation gate that motivated
   the in-runner Python interpreter: if the model can author the
   technicals snippet itself (rolling means, ATR, S/R) over a
   ``tools.sql`` bars pull, we never need a server-side
   ``compute_technicals`` again. The implementation here is a
   straight one-liner over the new ``py`` verb.

Tool surface
------------

Each tool is a :class:`Tool` dataclass carrying its name,
human-readable description, OpenAI-shaped JSON parameters schema,
and the Python callable. The runtime (:mod:`reef.react`) feeds
the schemas into ``llm.chat(tools=[...])`` and dispatches by name
when the model returns ``tool_calls``. Personas pick subsets via
:data:`STOCK_ANALYST_TOOLS` / :data:`SECTOR_ANALYST_TOOLS` /
:data:`VC_ANALYST_TOOLS` / :data:`RISK_ANALYST_TOOLS` -- same
roster shape the legacy code shipped, fewer LOC behind it.

Index slugs
-----------

The IA-facing names map to index slugs registered in the platform's
:class:`~gateway.store.indices.IndexRegistrationStore` via
:mod:`alphacumen.index_map`. The slugs are *not* baked into the tool
bodies so a deployment can re-target an index by editing one map
entry rather than chasing call sites; the manifest's ``indices``
list is the contract.

# Shared JSON-schema fragment for the optional ``bind_as`` parameter.
# Every search / retrieval / SQL tool exposes this knob so the model
# has a uniform way to ask "also make this result available as a
# Python variable so I can reference it from `run_python` later
# without re-emitting the bytes". Defined once and spliced into each
# tool's `parameters` so a future docstring tweak doesn't require
# touching every tool.
#
# Design note: ``bind_as`` does NOT change what the model sees in
# the tool response. The full (embedding-stripped) envelope is
# returned either way; the only effect of `bind_as` is the
# additional side effect of binding the value into the in-runner
# interpreter's globals so a later `run_python` snippet can
# reference it by name. This matters for OUTPUT-token cost (the
# model never has to re-emit a 5KB hits list as a `run_python(
# inputs={...})` argument) but does NOT alter what enters the
# model's context on this turn -- the kernel-side embedding strip
# is what keeps the on-the-wire payload manageable; bodies (the
# only remaining heavy field) the model usually wants to read
# inline anyway.

    exposes a flat, domain-DSL shape to personas that's easier for
    the LLM to populate reliably (see the memory-demo ``search_sec``
    tool for the lineage -- LLMs pin named attribute slots far more
    reliably than they nest the right DSL tree). Flat keys translate:

    - scalar value -> ``term`` clause (exact match)
    - list value -> ``terms`` clause (any-of)
    - ``<field>_gte`` / ``_lte`` / ``_gt`` / ``_lt`` suffix -> ``range``
      clause (with the bound op matching the suffix)

    Known DSL clauses in the input pass through verbatim; flat keys
    alongside them merge into the same output dict so callers can

    The legacy implementation did a hybrid BM25+ANN+RRF on the same
    corpus inside one tool; we deliberately do not fuse here. The
    gateway runs the embedder server-side from raw text so the
    pipeline never has to know about BGE-M3, and the model can mix
    in the lexical leg by separately invoking
    :data:`BM25_SCRAPED_ARTICLES` against the same index. Cross-verb
    fusion (BM25 + ANN) is the model's job, not the tool's.

    ``filters`` accept the same flat-or-DSL shape as the sibling
    BM25 tools (forwarded to ``cb_tools.ann``). They are applied
    **before** the HNSW scoring stage -- the kNN graph is restricted
    to docs that match the filter, not post-filtered after the fact.
    Without a filter the cluster runs unfiltered HNSW over the full
    corpus (~29M docs); on a cold cache that can blow past the
    gateway's vector timeout. Passing a tight ``published_date``
    range is the single biggest knob for keeping ANN latency in
    budget.

    When ``bind_as`` is set, the projected envelope is also bound
    under that name in the in-runner Python interpreter for use
    in a later ``run_python`` snippet (e.g. RRF fusion with the
    sibling BM25 leg). The return value is unchanged.

# **non-GAAP operating KPIs** (Netflix ARM, Spotify MAU, segment KPI
# tables) that the issuer publishes in MD&A as plain HTML tables but
# does NOT tag in iXBRL. ``get_xbrl_facts`` returns nothing for those
# concepts; ``get_full_text`` returns the chunk-flattened text where
# ``<table>`` boundaries have already been collapsed to newlines by
# the SEC ingestion pipeline (``data_prep/sec_edgar/clean_filings``
# strips/flattens HTML at index time). To get the structured table
# back we have to fetch the raw filing HTML upstream of the index.
#
# Two-step path (both via sec-api, already in the manifest egress):
#   1. Query API: accession -> filing's primary document URL
#   2. Extractor API: filing URL + (optional) item -> HTML region
# Then parse with BeautifulSoup, find tables matching a caption /
# heading / first-column substring, and return each as Markdown rows.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why this exists. bm25_sec runs against ``sec_filings_chunked`` (an
# OpenSearch ingestion of SEC EDGAR). Two failure modes leave a
# substantively-correct question unanswerable from the index alone:
#
# 1. Ingestion gap on a specific accession. The Item 5.07 vote-result
#    8-K Foot Locker filed 2022-05-20 is filed by proxy agent CIK
#    0001539497 (not FL's own CIK 0000850209), and is missing from
#    the index, while the same-day earnings 8-K filed by FL itself is
#    indexed normally. The pattern repeats at other issuers --
#    proxy-agent-filed 5.07s are systematically under-indexed.
# 2. Recency-floor wall (see :func:`_do_bm25_sec` -- ``filed_at_gte``
#    auto-injection at today-730d). Without an explicit date filter
#    older filings are invisible.
#
# This tool reaches EDGAR directly: ticker -> CIK via the public
# company_tickers.json, then EDGAR's browse-edgar atom feed for
# filings list, then per-filing directory walk -> primary document
# HTML -> BS4 text. www.sec.gov is already on the manifest's egress
# allowlist (added for the DEF 14A path :func:`_fetch_filing_html_from_edgar`
# took earlier), so no platform change is needed to roll this out.

# 7-round max-step budget on 16 per-ticker `get_equity_bars` calls
# that mostly returned empty (wrong start/end format guesses,
# per-ticker retries on bad arg shape). Specialist then reported
# "the tools do not include price data" — incorrect, the tool does,
# but the model used it wrong. The data is present in equity_bars_v1
# (verified via direct probe: NOW/HUBS/TOST/AAPL/SPY all have bars
# through 2026-02-27 with 252 trading days for 2024).

# encode the multi-ticker fan-out in code so the model makes ONE
# call instead of N×M per-cell calls.
# Returns the start_close / end_close / pct_return matrix + per-

#
# Why this exists. Multi-quarter beat-or-miss questions (e.g. "by how
# much did [issuer] beat/miss its non-GAAP gross profit guide in each
# of the last 4 quarters") require finding 5 separate 8-Ks: the Q4 of FY-1
# (which provides Q1 FY guidance), then each of Q1-Q4 FY (each provides
# the next quarter's guidance + the prior quarter's actuals). Without help
# the model burns 8-12 bm25_sec calls rediscovering the right filings, gets
# distracted by 10-K/10-Q hits, and frequently quotes guidance from the
# wrong quarter. This tool packages the 5 8-Ks in one call so the model can
# focus on extraction + arithmetic.
#
# Output shape: per-quarter pairs of (guidance_8k_ref, actuals_8k_ref) plus
# the raw list of 8-Ks found. Model then calls get_full_text on each ref
# (or extract_filing_tables) to pull guidance ranges and actual values, and
# uses run_python for the beat/miss math.

         guidance.
      2. Call ``get_full_text(actuals_8k_ref)`` for the actual figures.
      3. Use ``run_python`` to compute beat/miss as
         ``(actual - guidance_midpoint) / guidance_midpoint * 100``.
         For "non-GAAP gross profit" questions specifically:

# The two Reddit tools mirror what the legacy gdelt swarm carries
# in ``gdelt.project.reddit_sentiment_s3`` (raw boto3 + DuckDB
# httpfs against ``s3://.../research-tables/reddit/pullpush/``)
# but expressed over the platform's ``tools.sql`` verb so the alphacumen
# pipeline keeps its "no direct backend access from user code"
# property. The platform registers two views on the
# ``reddit_pullpush_v1`` index:
#
# - ``sentiment_daily`` -- one row per (ticker, subreddit, obs_date)
#   carrying ``post_count``, ``avg_sentiment``,
#   ``score_weighted_sentiment``, ``total_score``, ``top_post_title``,
#   ``top_post_id``. Pre-aggregated VADER on the body+title text;
#   used for "is retail sentiment improving / deteriorating" style
#   questions.
# - ``posts`` -- one row per Reddit submission with ``post_id``,
#   ``subreddit``, ``obs_date``, ``title``, ``selftext``, ``score``,
#   ``upvote_ratio``, ``num_comments``, ``tickers_mentioned``,
#   ``sentiment_score``, ``sentiment_label``, ``url``. Used for
#   keyword search over individual discussions.
#
# Coverage ceiling is ~ May 2025 (pullpush.io indexing horizon);
# queries beyond that return empty rows, NOT errors -- the persona
# supplement explains this so the model doesn't keep retrying.

# Default subreddit roster when the model doesn't pass one. Mirrors
# the "general subs (no canonical_tickers)" set that
# :func:`gdelt.project.reddit_sentiment_s3._load_registries` falls
# back to. Kept here (rather than pulled from the gateway) so the
# tool surface is self-describing -- the model can read the enum

    """``compute_technicals`` is now ``get_equity_bars`` + ``tools.py``.

    Pull bars over the window, then hand the rows + the symbol to
    the in-runner Python interpreter, which evaluates either the
    default :data:`_TECHNICALS_DEFAULT_SNIPPET` or a model-supplied
    ``code=`` override. The default snippet computes the same set
    of stats the legacy server-side ``compute_technicals`` returned
    (SMA20/50, ATR14, recent range), so persona-level expectations
    don't shift.

    Why this exists alongside :data:`RUN_PYTHON`
    --------------------------------------------

    This is a *server-side composition*: the bars never enter the
    model's context. A 1-year daily window is ~250 rows of OHLCV
    (~12 KB JSON); going through the model would mean 12 KB into
    the next prompt and 12 KB back out as the ``run_python(inputs=...)``
    arg, plus an extra LLM round-trip and a brittle JSON copy. So
    the rule is:

    - Voluminous "fetch X then compute Y(X)" -> use this tool, the
      bars stay inside the tool boundary.
    - Cheap "compute over things the model already saw" (RRF on a
      handful of search hits, regrouping macro rows, dedup) -> use
      :data:`RUN_PYTHON` directly.

    The two-call pattern (``sql`` then ``py``) is deliberately
    visible -- it's the canonical example of the new tools.py
    contract: pull rows over the wire, do the math locally with
    the Python interpreter, never round-trip dataframes back
    through the gateway. Personas can author their own snippets
    (rolling Bollinger bands, custom support/resistance, regime
    classifiers) without a platform release.

# Micro-cap screening primitives. These three tools fill the gap that
# caused the swarm to refuse "find me X-bagger micro-caps" queries: the
# stock_analyst persona had no way to pull market-cap, public float, or
# Form-4 insider-buying data.
#
# Implementation strategy: ride on the existing sec-api.io plumbing.
# - compute_market_cap = recent shares-outstanding (cover-page XBRL)
#   times latest close from get_equity_bars.
# - compute_float = dei:EntityPublicFloat from the latest 10-K cover
#   page. (Quarterlies do not tag float.)
# - fetch_insider_trades = sec-api.io /insider-trading endpoint, the
#   canonical Form-4 transaction feed. Same host as the existing
#   manifest egress entry, so no manifest change needed.
